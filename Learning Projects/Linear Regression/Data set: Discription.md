****Linear Regression:****
Randomly created dataset for linear regression

****About Dataset****

***Context***

This is probably the dumbest dataset on Kaggle. The whole point is, however, to provide a common dataset for linear regression. Although such a dataset can easily be generated in Excel with random numbers, results would not be comparable.

***Content***

The training dataset is a CSV file with 700 data pairs (x,y). The x-values are numbers between 0 and 100. The corresponding y-values have been generated using the Excel function NORMINV(RAND(), x, 3). Consequently, the best estimate for y should be x.
The test dataset is a CSV file with 300 data pairs.

***Inspiration***

I hope this dataset will encourage all newbies to enter the world of machine learning, possibly starting with a simple linear regression.
