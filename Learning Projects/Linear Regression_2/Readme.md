**Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression**

This repository contains a dataset and code implementation for predicting students' scores based on the number of hours they study. The linear regression algorithm is utilized to perform this prediction task effectively.

**Dataset**

The dataset provided in this repository consists of two columns: "Hours" and "Scores". Each row represents a student's study hours and the corresponding score achieved by the student. This dataset serves as the training data for building the linear regression model.

**Code Implementation**

The code implementation, written in Python, demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict students' scores based on their study hours. The main steps in the code are as follows:

1. Loading and exploring the dataset

2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets

3. Creating a linear regression model

4. Training the model using the training data

5. Making predictions on the test data

6. Evaluating the model's performance by comparing the predicted scores with the actual scores

7. Visualizing the regression line and the actual vs. predicted scores
