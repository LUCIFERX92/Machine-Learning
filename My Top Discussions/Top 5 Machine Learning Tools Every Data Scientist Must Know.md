Machine learning is a crucial skill for data scientists, and to express statistical learning, they must have knowledge of various machine learning tools. In this post, we will explore the top 5 machine learning tools that every data scientist must know.

Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular, free, and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support vector machines.

Scikit-learn offers simple tools for data-mining and analysis of data, making it easy to implement. Additionally, it has advanced features like Ensemble Learning, Boosting, Dimensionality Reduction, and Parameter Tuning. Scikit-learn - https://scikit-learn.org/

NLTK: NLTK stands for Natural Language Tool Kit, and it is an open-source machine learning library designed for natural language processing. NLTK provides various symbolic and statistical tools for NLP, including stemming, lemmatization, tokenization, punctuation, character count, word count, etc.

Furthermore, NLTK provides an interface to over 50 corpora, which allows users to access text corpus. The most popular corpus in NLTK is the Gutenberg corpus, which consists of over 25,000 free books that can be analyzed. NLTK: https://www.nltk.org/

PyTorch: PyTorch is a Python-based open-source machine learning package supported by Torch, which is an open-source machine learning package supported by the programming language Lua. It is an open deep-learning framework developed by Facebook AI, offering two main important features: tensors and deep neural networks.

PyTorch is most famous for research and prototyping, and it is being popularly used for high-end research purposes as well as building software pipelines. Uber's probabilistic programming language software called "Pyro" uses the PyTorch framework. PyTorch - https://pytorch.org/

Keras: Keras is a minimalist Python library for deep learning, and it is a powerful API used for building powerful neural networks. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

Using Keras, you can perform dynamic prototyping, and it is also easy to learn that supports convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, Keras is capable of running on top of the GPU and CPU, and it provides readable code for the users.Keras: https://keras.io/

Apache Spark: Apache Spark is an open-source Big Data Platform that provides data parallelism and extensive support for fault tolerance. It is an improvement over the older big data platforms like Hadoop because it provides real-time data streaming capability. Apache Spark: https://spark.apache.org/

Furthermore, Spark provides various data processing tools like Machine Learning. Apache Spark is the most in-demand skill in IT technology, making it an essential tool for data scientists to learn.

Hope this will help you out!!
