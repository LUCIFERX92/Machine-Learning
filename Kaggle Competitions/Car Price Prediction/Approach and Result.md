Part 1: Data Loading and Understanding

As a first step, I begin by loading the dataset into my program. In this case, I am working with a CSV file, so I use the appropriate function to read the data into a DataFrame. Once the data is loaded, I assign it to a variable for easy access.

After loading the data, I want to gain a better understanding of its structure and contents. I start by examining the shape of the DataFrame using the shape attribute. This gives me the number of rows and columns in the dataset, helping me gauge its size.

To get a sense of the actual data, I print out the first few rows using the head() function. This allows me to see the column headers and some sample data points. It serves as a quick visual check to ensure that the data was loaded correctly.

Part 2: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

To further explore the data, I begin by checking for missing values. By using the isnull().sum() function, I can determine the number of missing values in each column. This helps me identify any potential gaps in the data and decide how to handle them.

Additionally, I use the columns attribute of the DataFrame to obtain a list of all the column names. This provides an overview of the available features in the dataset. Understanding the column names is crucial as it helps me identify which variables I can use for analysis or modeling.

Data exploration and preprocessing are crucial steps in any data analysis or machine learning task. These steps allow me to gain insights into the data, identify any data quality issues, and prepare the dataset for further analysis. By performing these initial steps, I can ensure that the subsequent analysis and modeling processes are based on a solid foundation of clean and well-understood data.
