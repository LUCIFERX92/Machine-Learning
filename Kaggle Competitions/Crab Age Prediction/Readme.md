# Regression with a Crab Age Dataset
Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 16

Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series!
Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!

With the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in May every other Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 2 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

# Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE),

MAE

where each x_i represents the predicted target, y_i represents the ground truth, and n is the number of rows in the test set.

# Time Line

Start Date - May 30, 2023
Entry Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
Team Merger Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
Final Submission Deadline - June 12, 2023
