**Hotel Booking Cancellations Prediction**

Booking cancellations can have a significant impact on a hotel's revenue and bottom line. When a reservation is cancelled, the hotel may not be able to book that room again, resulting in lost revenue. To mitigate this risk, hotels often require a booking deposit, which is usually a percentage of the reservation's full price. However, requiring a deposit can also have negative consequences, such as dissuading some customers from booking at the hotel altogether.

To address this challenge, our Kaggle competition aims to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a hotel booking will be cancelled or not. By predicting cancellations in advance, hotels can implement risk-aware strategies for calculating deposit sizes and making other operational decisions that help them maximize occupancy rates and revenue.

**The Challenge**

In this competition, you will work with real-world anonymized data from two different hotels to develop a model that predicts whether a booking will be cancelled or not. The data set includes a range of features, such as:

The booking date
The length of the stay
The number of guests
And other relevant information that can help inform the model's predictions
Your challenge is to create a classifier that accurately predicts whether a given booking will be cancelled or not.

**The Goal**

By participating in this Kaggle competition, you will have the opportunity to:

Apply your machine learning skills to a real-world business problem
Develop innovative solutions that can help hotels improve their revenue and bottom line
Showcase your skills and learn from other participants
Whether you're an experienced data scientist or a newcomer to the field, this competition offers a challenging and rewarding opportunity to showcase your skills and learn from other participants.

**Data**

The files provided are:

Training set (tb_hotel_traintest.csv) with all features and the response variable (is_cancelled)
Validation set (tb_hotel_feat_valid.csv) with all features for making predictions
Sample submission (tb_hotel_sample_valid.csv), which is an example of the file you must submit with predictions made from the validation set.
